      PROGRAM QUAD4
C
C     This program reads the coefficients of a quadratic equation of 
C     the form
C           A * X**2 + B * X + C = 0,
C     and solves for the roots of the equation (FORTRAN 77 style).
C
C     Get the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
C
      WRITE (*,*) 'Enter the coefficients A, B and C: '
      READ (*,*) A, B, C
C
C     Echo the coefficients to make sure they are entered correctly.
C 
      WRITE (*,100) 'The coefficients are : ', A, B, C

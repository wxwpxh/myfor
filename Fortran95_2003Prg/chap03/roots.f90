PROGRAM roots

!  Purpose:
!    This program solves for the roots of a quadratic equation of the 
!    form a*x**2 + b*x + c = 0.  It calculates the answers regardless
!    of the type of roots that the equation possesses.

! Data dictionary: declare variable types, definitions, & units  
REAL :: a              ! Coefficient of x**2 term of equation
REAL :: b              ! Coefficient of x term of equation
REAL :: c              ! Constant term of equation
REAL :: discriminant   ! Discriminant of the equation
REAL :: imag_part      ! Imaginary part of equation (for complex roots)
REAL :: real_part      ! Real part of equation (for complex roots)
REAL :: x1             ! First solution of equation (for real roots)
REAL :: x2             ! Second solution of equation (for real roots)

! Prompt the user for the coefficients of the equation
WRITE (*,*) 'This program solves for the roots of a quadratic '
WRITE (*,*) 'equation of the form A * X**2 + B * X + C = 0. '
WRITE (*,*) 'Enter the coefficients A, B, and C: '
READ  (*,*) a, b, c

! Echo back coefficients
WRITE (*,*) 'The coefficients A, B, and C are: ', a, b, c  

! Calculate discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4. * a * c     

! Solve for the roots, depending upon the value of the discriminant
IF ( discriminant > 0. ) THEN ! there are two real roots, so...

   x1 = ( -b + sqrt(discriminant) ) / ( 2. * a )
   x2 = ( -b - sqrt(discriminant) ) / ( 2. * a )
   WRITE (*,*) 'This equation has two real roots:'
   WRITE (*,*) 'X1 = ', x1
   WRITE (*,*) 'X2 = ', x2

ELSE ( discriminant < 0. ) THEN ! there are complex roots, so ...

   real_part = ( -b ) / ( 2. * a )
   imag_part = sqrt ( abs ( discriminant ) ) / ( 2. * a )
   WRITE (*,*) 'This equation has complex roots:'
   WRITE (*,*) 'X1 = ', real_part, ' +i ', imag_part
   WRITE (*,*) 'X2 = ', real_part, ' -i ', imag_part

ELSE IF ( discriminant == 0. ) THEN ! there is one repeated root, so...

   x1 = ( -b ) / ( 2. * a )
   WRITE (*,*) 'This equation has two identical real roots:'
   WRITE (*,*) 'X1 = X2 = ', x1
